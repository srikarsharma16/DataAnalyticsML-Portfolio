SL No.,Change Category,Description,Duration (mins),Difficulty (1-10)
1,Dataset,Updated the dataset path to use a new GlobalWeatherRepository.csv dataset instead of the Seattle weather dataset.,10,3
2,Feature Selection,Added more weather-related features: humidity | pressure_mb | wind_kph | visibility_km along with temperature_celsius to the dataset improving the model's ability to predict.,15,4
3,Data Preprocessing,Removed missing values and normalized the dataset using MinMaxScaler to ensure better model convergence.,15,4
4,Model Architecture,Replaced the RNN model with a Transformer architecture using MultiHeadAttention and Dense layers for improved sequence processing.,30,7
5,Model Layers,Added LayerNormalization and Dropout layers for regularization and to avoid overfitting improving the generalization ability of the model.,20,6
6,Sequence Preparation,Updated the sequence preparation logic to match the new dataset and transformer model generating sequences of length 10.,15,4
7,Model Compilation,Changed model compilation to use the Adam optimizer with learning_rate=0.001 and MSE loss for regression tasks.,10,3
8,Training and Evaluation,Added validation data during training and improved loss evaluation by plotting both train and validation loss.,20,4
9,Model Saving,Updated model saving format to store the Transformer model with the name weather_transformer_model.h5.,5,2
10,Visualization,Added visualizations for training and validation loss to help track model performance over epochs.,10,4
