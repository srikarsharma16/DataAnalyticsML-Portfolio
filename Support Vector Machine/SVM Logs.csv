SL No.,Change Category,Description,Duration (mins),Difficulty (1-10)
1,Base Code Selection,Used SVM-based classification from IPython Cookbook as the base implementation.,10,2
2,Dataset Change,Replaced synthetic random data with the real-world penguins dataset from Seaborn.,20,4
3,Feature Selection,Chose bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm as input features encoding species as categorical target.,15,3
4,Data Preprocessing,Used StandardScaler to normalize the feature space for better SVM performance.,20,4
5,Train-Test Split,Implemented an 80-20 split for training and testing using train_test_split.,15,2
6,Model Selection,Replaced LinearSVC() with SVC() to support non-linear decision boundaries.,25,5
